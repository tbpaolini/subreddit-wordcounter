# Subreddit word counter

This script counts how many times each user has said a word or sentence on a subreddit.

In order to use it you need to have [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the module [Praw](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).

Optionally, you can download our standalone Windows executable (which does not need Python or Praw installed):
